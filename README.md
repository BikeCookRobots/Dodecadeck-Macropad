# Dodecadeck-Macropad
A macropad featuring a 4 inch eink screen

# code
install circuit python per the instructions online
ensure that you have the following libraries installed to the board as well
- adafruit_display_text
- adafruit_hid
- adafruit_ssd1683
- neopixel

add the `boot.py` and `code.py` to your board

# hardware
TODO rework the design so everything is using the same size screw
STL and freecad files are provided. 
may need some modification of diameters and lengths to fit to your screen
I printed everything in PLA with default orca slicer settings

(fun fact, the hole mounting pattern on the PCB is not random, it is one of the smallest VESA standards)
